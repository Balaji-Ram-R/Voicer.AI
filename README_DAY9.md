# Day 9: The Full Non-Streaming Pipeline

## 🎯 What's New

Your AI Voice Agent now has a complete non-streaming pipeline that:

1. **Records audio** from your microphone
2. **Transcribes** the audio using AssemblyAI
3. **Sends the transcript** to Google Gemini LLM
4. **Generates AI response** audio using Murf TTS
5. **Plays back** the AI's spoken response

## 🚀 How to Use

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have these environment variables set in your `.env` file:
```
MURF_API_KEY=your_murf_api_key
ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=your_assemblyai_api_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

### Step-by-Step Usage

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   python -m uvicorn app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

2. **Open your browser** and go to `http://localhost:8000`

3. **Select a voice** from the dropdown menu

4. **Click "Start Recording"** and speak your question

5. **Click "Stop Recording"** when done

6. **Review your recording** using the audio player

7. **Click "Ask AI Voice Agent"** to process your question

8. **Listen to the AI response** - it will automatically play!

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### New Endpoint: `/llm/query`

- **Input:** Audio file (WebM format)
- **Process:** Audio → Transcription → LLM → TTS → Audio Response
- **Output:** JSON with audio URL, transcript, and LLM response

### Character Limit Handling

The Murf API has a 3000 character limit. The system automatically:
- Truncates responses to fit within the limit
- Tries to end at sentence boundaries for natural speech
- Adds ellipsis if no good break point is found

### Error Handling

- Validates all required API keys
- Handles transcription failures gracefully
- Provides clear error messages for debugging

## 🎵 Voice Options

The system automatically loads available voices from Murf API. You can:
- Choose different voices for different types of responses
- Switch voices between questions
- Use voices in different languages (if available)

## 📱 UI Features

- **Real-time status updates** showing processing steps
- **Transcript display** showing what you said
- **AI response display** showing the generated text
- **Audio player** for the AI's spoken response
- **Modern, responsive design** with cyberpunk aesthetic

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test script to verify everything is working:
```bash
python test_llm_pipeline.py
```

## 🎬 LinkedIn Video Requirements

For your LinkedIn post, demonstrate:
1. Recording a question (e.g., "What's the weather like today?")
2. The AI processing and responding
3. Playing back the AI's spoken response
4. Show the transcript and response text

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

- **No audio recording:** Check microphone permissions
- **Transcription fails:** Verify AssemblyAI API key
- **LLM errors:** Check Gemini API key and quota
- **TTS fails:** Verify Murf API key and voice selection

## 🚀 Next Steps

Your AI Voice Agent is now ready for:
- Customer service applications
- Educational content
- Interactive storytelling
- Voice-controlled assistants
- And much more!
